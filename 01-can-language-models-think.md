for LMs is only form; they do not have access to meaning. Therefore,
claims about model abilities must be carefully characterized.

Can language models think?

We should define these terms: For our purposes, a "language model" is some computer program, running on real hardware, producing a sequence of text output. As of this writing, such a model is probably a descendant of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al, 2017). This architecture and the techniques surrounding it (gradient descent, cross-entropy loss, et cetera) are very important for recent research in the field, but the only essential characteristic of a "language model" is that it produces text as its output.

What does it mean for a language model to think? Any normal use of the word "think" does not seem like it will work here. Ultimately, what we mean when we say "think" is "able to do the sorts of things that humans do". This insight is, of course, originally from Alan Turing. There is a specific test, the "Turing test", that is proposed as a general purpose test for whether some computer program, outputting only text, is as smart as a human.
